- By using container orchestration, for example **Kubernetes (EKS)**, only the resources that were being used would be chargeable. 
- This means that the number of “Pods” required for services to run at maximum efficiency would reap the reward of $$$ reduced costs in the form of overhead for my company, and happy customers, whom can easily run resource intensive reporting applications. 
- Service Discovery helps by providing a database of available service instances so that services can be discovered, registered, and de-registered.  
- Examples: An AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Application Load Balancer (ALB), is an example of server-side discovery. A client makes HTTP(s) requests (or opens TCP connections) to the ELB, which load balances the traffic amongst a set of EC2 instances.

AWS CDK allows you to have infrastructure as code, and all changes will be stored in a code repository. For a deployment, AWS CDK builds an AWS CloudFormation template, which is a standard way to model infrastructure on AWS. Additionally, AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) allows you to test and debug your serverless code locally, meaning that you can indeed create a continuous integration.
This is an example of a web scraper running on AWS Lambda and Lambda Layers. It assumes, that you have AWS CDK and Docker installed. The docker image relies on serverless-chrome.
